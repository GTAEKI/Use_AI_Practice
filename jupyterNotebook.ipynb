       "AIMessageChunk(content=\"For a vegetarian version of Chicken Tikka Masala, you can easily replace the chicken with a plant-based alternative such as tofu or paneer. Here's how you can prepare these alternatives:\\n\\n1. **Tofu**: \\n   - Use firm or extra-firm tofu for this recipe.\\n   - Press the tofu to remove excess water: Place the block of tofu between paper towels or clean kitchen towels, then place a heavy object on top (like a cast-iron skillet) for about 15-30 minutes.\\n   - Cut the tofu into bite-sized cubes and follow the marinating and baking instructions as you would with the chicken. Tofu absorbs flavors well, so the marination time can be similar to chicken.\\n\\n2. **Paneer**:\\n   - Paneer is a type of Indian cheese that holds its shape well when cooked.\\n   - Cut the paneer into cubes and lightly pan-fry them until they develop a golden crust before adding them to the sauce. This step helps the paneer hold its shape and prevents it from crumbling in the sauce.\\n\\nBy using tofu or paneer as a substitute for chicken, you can enjoy a flavorful and satisfying vegetarian version of Chicken Tikka Masala. Feel free to adjust the cooking times and seasonings to suit your preferences. Enjoy your vegetarian twist on this classic Indian dish!\")"
